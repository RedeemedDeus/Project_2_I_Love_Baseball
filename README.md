# Project_2_I_Love_Baseball
This is a simple trip advisory app that uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to get the best/shortest path from one stadium to another visiting other stadiums in the process.
Use Qt Cretor to run this program as there are some frontend UI elements that require the Qt creator design tool.
Make sure to put the MLB_Stadium_Map.png on your build folder if you don't have mine, if not, build the program locally and add it to your own build folder, otherwise it won't display the picture.
